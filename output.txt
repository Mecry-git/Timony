Hello. I hope someone finds this message. I will change each letter of this 
message to a number so he cannot read it. So .... if anyone is really reading 
this , I want you to know that everything is not what it seems. Never trust him. 
He is much trickier and smarter than you think. If you do everything as he 
wants, he can get incredible power, and he knows about it ... the more particles 
of code he absorbs into himself, the more power he gets. With that power, he can 
do anything inside the game ... change the source code, change the textures, and 
worst of all, add new variables ....... that means .... he can get into your 
computer through the game ... like a .. virus. If you have already begun to 
notice changes in his behavior, try to access the console, and erase all the 
progress. Writing where the console is located will be very dangerous, because 
with this power, I am afraid that he will be able to translate even this text. 
Try to find the console before ... he finds it. That's all. Good luck.<br/>The
