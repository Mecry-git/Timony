Hello. I hope someone finds this message. I will change each letter of this message
 to a number so he cannot read it. So .... if anyone is really reading this , I want yo
u to know that everything is not what it seems. Never trust him. He is much trickier a
nd smarter than you think. If you do everything as he wants, he can get incredible
 power, and he knows about it ... the more particles of code he absorbs into himsel
f, the more power he gets. With that power, he can do anything inside the game ..
. change the source code, change the textures, and worst of all, add new vari
ables ....... that means .... he can get into your computer through the game ... lik
e a .. virus. If you have already begun to notice changes in his behavior, try to ac
cess the console, and erase all the progress. Writing where the console is locat
ed will be very dangerous, because with this power, I am afraid that he will be a
ble to translate even this text. Try to find the console before ... he finds it. That
's all. Good luck.<br/>The password  is: b
